# Welcome!

This is a small personal project that I've been using to hone my full stack development skills.
In particular, I wanted to further my understanding of Docker Compose, how containers interact, and simple application building.
I wanted to use MySQL in particular, since I hadn't interacted with it at all during school, and it seemed like a valuable technology to learn.
I defaulted to using Docker Compose and PHP since these frameworks were more familiar to me, and I didn't want to introduce too many new technologies at once.
I have ambitions of running this service using Google Kubernetes to gain hands-on experience with DevOps tools.
